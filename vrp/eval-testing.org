* Documentation
Lets test the evaluation graph integrated on the system. We will, step by step, build a problem with an initial solution with the classes defined in ==vrp-suite== and use the ==eval-graph-builder= to explore the neighborhood efficiently. 

* Automatic evaluations for variants

In this section we will evaluate the neighbor solutions in the basic VRP, the CVRP and the MDVRP.
All the code needed to represent those variants and the evaluation of a solution is done.
To learn how to apply the automatic evaluation to new variants see the next section.
